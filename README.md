# Computer Control Remotely   

This project demonstrates a Python-based client–server system for remote control and monitoring in a local network, where a server sends keyboard commands to a client and receives screenshots in response. The purpose is to explore network communication, input automation, and screen capture in a controlled environment. The scope includes real-time keyboard events and image data transmitted over sockets, intended for educational and experimental use.
